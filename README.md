Project Name: [URL_Checker]

Date of Creation: [4/5/2023]

## Description

Comprehensive URL checker that accurately determines whether a given URL is malicious or not. The system utilizes a decision tree algorithm for classification and employs advanced dataset preprocessing techniques to achieve high accuracy in its predictions.
Key Features of the URL Checker:
1. Dataset Preprocessing: The dataset used for training the decision tree model is carefully preprocessed to ensure reliable predictions. This involves handling missing data, removing duplicates, and performing feature engineering to extract relevant information from the URLs.
2. Feature Extraction: The URL checker extracts a wide range of features from the URLs, including domain information, URL length, presence of special characters, subdomain count, and more. These features provide valuable insights into the characteristics of the URLs, enabling the decision tree algorithm to make informed predictions.
3. Decision Tree Algorithm: The decision tree algorithm is trained using the preprocessed dataset to create a robust and accurate model. The decision tree learns patterns and rules from the extracted features to classify URLs as either malicious or non-malicious.
